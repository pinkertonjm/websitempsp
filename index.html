  <h1>Basic Recommendations For High School Athletes</h1>
    <div class="info">
    <!-- this div should make the writing stand out from the black background. -->
      <p>Welcome to the Generic Athletic Association’s site for high school athletes. Here you will find stellar recommendations for your overall health and wellness, regardless of the sport you play, and will have access to the blogs of two current students who have participated in a high school sport themselves. Whether you are looking to get into a sport or are just here for health tips, we’ve got you covered.</p>

      <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Having a well balanced diet is important because you want to keep your energy up, but not by eating junk. If you eat a diet filled with things like trans fats and simple sugars, you aren’t going to be able to develop your muscles in a healthy way, but more importantly, you will start gaining weight that you need to avoid in the world of athletics. If you’re having problems sticking to a healthy diet, you’re not going to last long, both due to weight gain and the fact that you won’t have the energy to play your best. Above is an example of a relatively healthy way to structure your diet, but you can make the edits to it that you think will best suit your caloric needs.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <h2>Agility</h2>
      <p>Agility is important for most sports. Being agile is just being able to move quickly and in different directions. You need to be able to decrease your response time so that you can respond to where the ball is going or the moves your opponent might try to use as quickly as possible. If you’re not already doing agility training, <a href="https://greatist.com/fitness/agility-exercises-to-improve-coordination">here’s a site</a> that will help you get started. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <h2>Stamina<h2>
      <p>Stamina is important because if you don't have it you won't be able to perform that long.Increasing your stamina is arguably the hardest part out of these basic recommendations. We’re here to recommend some ways you might not have tried, including
        <ul>
         <li><b>reducing your recovery times when working out.</b> If you make reps slightly easier in some way, you won’t have to recover as much, which will increase your stamina with time.</li>
         <li><b>doing more frequent workouts.</b> If you work out 3-5 times a week, doing as much as you can with the minimum of breaks, you will increase your stamina much more quickly than you would think.</li>
         <li><b>doing strength workouts and cardio workouts on the same day.</b> If you increase the amount of muscles working at once, you’ll push your cardiovascular system, which will help build it and increase your stamina greatly.</li>
       </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <h2>Hand Eye coordination</h2>
      <img src="maxresdefault.jpg" />
      <p>Hand-eye coordination is very important for most sports because you need to be able to move your body to see where stuff is moving and what's going on. If Ronda Rousey had better hand eye coordination, she wouldn't have been kicked in the head. In many ways, this has to do with the agility of an athlete, but it has the additional step of training so that you know what the proper timing is. You don’t always need to be agile if you can see what’s coming and stop it from pushing you into a corner. This one can really only be achieved by practice, practice, and even more practice to see when, where, and how something’s coming at you. </p>
